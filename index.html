  <h1>Cost of 24-hour Baseload Solar + Storage</h1>
  <p>The sun shines everywhere, but not all the time. Combined with batteries,
  though, the hybrid system becomes fully dispatchable. Using a simple model we
  show how much it would cost to provide a constant 24-hour source of energy
  using just solar and batteries. Of course, it depends on a few factors,
  especially the total installed cost of solar and batteries and a couple of
  other factors listed below.</p>

  <p>Use the dropdown menus below to vary the factors:</p>

    <h4>Assumptions</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Based on a 1MW off-grid system. Connecting a larger system to an
        existing grid could significantly lower the cost but complicate the
        analysis due to a variety of utility regulations.</li>
      <li>Hourly solar radiation data for Denver Colorado from NRELâ€™s National
        Solar Radiation Database.</li>
      <li>All system development and equipment costs need to be allocated to
        the three factors listed.</li>
      <li>Controllable loads could be any load that has flexibility about when
        it is served.</li>

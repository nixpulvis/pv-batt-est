  <h1>Cost of 24-hour Baseload Solar + Storage</h1>
  <p>The sun shines everywhere. But it doesnâ€™t shine all of the time. We used a
  simple model to show how much it would cost to combine solar photovoltaics
  with enough batteries to provide a constant 24-hour source of energy. Of
  course, it depends on a few factors, most notably the total installed cost of
  solar and batteries and a couple of other factors listed below. Use the
  dropdown menus to vary those factors.</p>

    <h3>Assumptions</h3>

    <p>Based on a 1MW off-grid system. Connecting a larger system to an
    existing grid could lower the cost but complicate the analysis due to a
    variety of utility regulations.</p>

    <p>Hourly solar radiation data from Denver, Colorado from NREL's National
    Solar Radiation Database.</p>

    <p>All system development and equipment costs need to be allocated to the
    three factors listed.</p>

    <p>Controllable loads could be any load that has flexibility about when it
    is served.</p>
